### CONFIGURATION FOR SLOPE COMPUTATION

# provide max segment length in meters (slope will be computed for each segment separately)
segment_length: 100  

# provide slope ranges in the format 
# slope_ranges : [0, a, b, c] (where a, b, c refer to elevation %)
# this will be used to classify the edges by slope:
# edges with a slope within the interval [0, a] --> "Manageable elevation"
# edges with a slope within the interval [a, b] --> "Noticeable elevation"
# edges with a slope within the interval [b, c] --> "Steep elevation"
# edges with a slope above c --> "Very steep elevation"
slope_ranges: [0, 3, 5, 7]
